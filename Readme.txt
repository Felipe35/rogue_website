This a basic website where I used my imagination to create it.

Some features needs to be corrected latter on.

NOTE: For any reason I can not put the mediaQueries on top of the css code.
The css is not recognizing it, I'm not sure why, but I was able to do it, by
only adding the the whole MediaQuery at the bottom of page.

Thanks!
