            In Wrath of the Lich King, Rogues can only be played by Humans,
            Dwarves, Night Elves, and Gnomes for the Alliance, or by Orcs,
            Undead, Trolls, and Blood Elves for the Horde. Unfortunately, unlike
            for casters, race matters a lot for a Rogue's DPS. Only 1-2 races
            per faction are considered viable.

              <strong>Trolls</strong> have the strongest racials for
              Assassination Rogues among Horde races. This is almost exclusively
              thanks to BerserkingBerserking temporarily giving you a +20%
              attack speed bonus, which is enormous when stacked with your
              trinkets and other cooldowns. However, Wow Orc Crest Orcs come
              very close in power.

                <strong>Troll:</strong> Trolls may not look the part, but they
                are the strongest race for Horde Assassination Rogues. Their
                on-use racial BerserkingBerserking is the biggest and bursty out
                of all of Horde racials — despite the Orc racial having a
                shorter cooldown, BerserkingBerserking, will usually be
                stronger.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Berserking</strong> is an on-use spell that offers
                    +20% increased attack speed for 10 seconds on a 3-minute
                    cooldown. The fact that this is an on-use ability has big
                    implications for burst phases / stacking your cooldowns.
                    However, the 3-minute cooldown is a bit awkward for us, as
                    it does not sync with any of our other cooldowns. Still,
                    Haste is a pretty powerful stat for us, making this racial
                    very solid anyway.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Beast</strong> Slaying increases your damage dealt
                    to Beast-type enemies by 5%, which is very powerful.
                    Unfortunately, there aren't a whole lot of Beasts in Wrath
                    of the Lich King, especially inside raids, making this
                    racial not too impressive in practice.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Da Voodoo</strong> Shuffle passively reduces the
                    duration of movement slowing & immobilizing effects on you
                    by 15%. Generally mostly a PvP racial, but it can
                    occasionally come in handy in PvE as well.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Bow Specialization</strong> increase your critical
                    strike chance with bows & throwing weapons by 1%. A neat
                    little bonus, but unlike Hunters, you only use your bow or
                    thrown weapon occasionally, thus mostly negligible.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Regeneration</strong> increases health regeneration
                    by 10% and allows you to regenerate health during combat at
                    10% of your normal regeneration rate. Rogues don't have any
                    active health regeneration abilities (it does not apply to
                    healing effects, like potions, just health regeneration)
                    thus this talent is only relevant while leveling or
                    questing.

                <strong>Orc:</strong> Orcs have several powerful racial effects
                that make them extremely strong overall — which is no
                coincidence, as the strongest Rogue assassin in Warcraft lore,
                Garona Halforcen, is an Orc. They are specially powerful in
                fights where they can use their Blood FuryBlood Fury racial more
                often than Trolls can use their BerserkingBerserking, thanks to
                its lower cooldown.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Blood Fury</strong> is an on-use spell that
                    increases your Attack Power and scales with your level. At
                    level 80 it will provide +322 Attack Power for 15 seconds on
                    a 2-minute cooldown.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Axe Specialization</strong> increases your expertise
                    by 5. This is unimportant for assassination as we use
                    daggers and daggers only.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Hardiness</strong> is an incredible PvP racial, as
                    Rogues can get killed fairly easily if they get stunned.
                    Sadly, it's not as relevant in PvE, as there aren't many
                    stuns this passive can help you with.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Command</strong> is a very powerful racial that
                    unfortunately does not apply to Rogues because they don't
                    have a pet (that we're aware of).

                <strong>Blood Elf:</strong> Female Blood Elf Rogues are cute as
                hell, indisputably. However, cuteness doesn't help you DPS,
                which is why Blood Elves are sadly a pretty weak race for
                Rogues. Their only helpful racial is Arcane TorrentArcane
                Torrent, which is pretty weak overall, but it makes them a tiny
                bit stronger than Undead, the weakest race.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Arcane Torrent</strong> is an on-use spell on a
                    2-minute cooldown that silences all enemies within 8 yards
                    for 2 seconds, while also restoring 15 of your Energy. The
                    silence effect can be useful in dungeons and PvP, but most
                    bosses are unfortunately immune to silence. The Energy
                    restoration component is handy, though it isn't much.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Magic Resistance</strong> reduces the chance you
                    will be hit by Magic spells by 2%. This essentially combines
                    all of the various Resistance-type racials out there, making
                    it surprisingly flexible. Still, its benefit is mostly
                    neglectable in PvE, while being alright in PvP.

                    <strong>Arcane Affinity</strong> increases your initial and
                    maximum Enchanting skill by 15. This doesn't have a gameplay
                    impact besides minor convenience.

            <strong>Humans</strong>Human CrestHuman is arguably the strongest
            Alliance race for Assassination Rogues, as none of the races really
            give a direct damage gain, but the Wow Human CrestHuman racial Every
            Man for HimselfEvery Man for Himself at least gets you out of CC,
            which can occasionally be useful. Realistically, however, you can
            pick any race you want without giving up too much — just play what
            looks coolest to you. If you plan to switch to Combat, or do PvP
            however, you're strongly encouraged to go Wow Human CrestHuman.

                <strong>Human:</strong> Often considered the best choice for
                Alliance Rogues, Humans provide several strong racial effects
                that can improve your overall gameplay. Every Man for
                HimselfEvery Man for Himself effectively acts as a trinket,
                allowing you to clear all CC. This allows Humans to use double
                DPS trinkets, boosting their damage by a considerable amount.
                This is by far the strongest PvP racial in the entire game, as
                it allows you to considerably boost your damage!
                PerceptionPerception greatly increases the chance to detect
                stealthed targets, giving us an advantage when fighting other
                classes that are capable of using stealth. This racial effect is
                great against other rogues or feral druids, as it allows you to
                engage first!. Humans also possess DiplomacyDiplomacy, an effect
                that increases your overall reputation gain by 10%. This effect
                can be quite handy when trying to grab items that require
                reputation grind.

                    <span>Every Man</span> for Himself is a crowd-control
                    removal ability just like the Undead race, but this one has
                    universal applicability. It is useful in PvE scenarios but
                    has much more use in a PvP encounter, where Humans are
                    typically considered the strongest race in the game.

                    3 when using swords or maces. Assassination Rogues use
                    daggers exclusively, so this racial will be useless to you
                    most of the time. However, if you're considering switching
                    to Combat at some point, these racials will be very good.

                    <span>Perception</span> passively increases your stealth
                    detection level by a small amount. Since there aren't a lot
                    of stealthed mobs in PvE, this benefit is largely not too
                    useful. However, this bonus is very

                    <span>Diplomacy</span> increases the rate at which you gain
                    reputation by 10%, a major boost for your reputation grind.
                    Whilst a beneficial quality of life racial, it doesn't
                    impact actual gameplay.

                    This is unfortunately nearly useless for Rogues.

                <span>Dwarf:</span> Dwarves are least common race for Rogues in
                WotLK, and for good reason — our racials aren't too useful.
                Unlike Humans, our weapon specialization racial isn't as useful
                if you're considering switching to Combat eventually, and our
                utility racial, StoneformStoneform, has very, very limited uses.
                This makes Dwarf Rogues by far the weakest Alliance Rogues,
                unfortunately.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <span>Stoneform</span> is an on-use spell that gives you
                    +10% increased armor for 8 seconds and dispels poison,
                    disease, and bleed effects on you, on a 2-minute cooldown.
                    There are occasions where this racial can help out with
                    predictable physical damage, and removing the occasional
                    bleed.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span>Gun Specialization</span> increases your critical
                    strike chance with guns by 1%. A neat little bonus, but
                    unlike Hunters, you only use your gun weapon occasionally,
                    thus this racial is mostly negligible.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span>Mace Specialization</span> increases your expertise by
                    5 when using maces. As we use daggers exclusively, this
                    racial will be useless to us — and Combat Rogues prefer
                    using swords or axes, so that racial won't help you much if
                    you respec, either.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span>Frost Resistance</span> reduces the chance you will be
                    hit by Frost spells by 2%. This is mostly a neglectable
                    racial when it comes to PvE.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span>Find Treasure</span> is a very cool racial from a
                    roleplay point of view, allowing you to see treasure on the
                    minimap. This is very fun to use while questing and leveling
                    up, and as a Rogue, you can stealth around looking for
                    chests, but it, unfortunately, has zero relevance in raids.

                  races, Night Elves have a higher base Agility stat than other
                  races, which makes them better than other races which simply
                  have no useful racial traits at all. Still, we're scraping the
                  bottom here, if we're being honest — this benefit is so small
                  that you could pick any of the other races and never notice a
                  difference. But they are technically the strongest race, from
                  a DPS-only perspective!.

                    melee and ranged attacks by 2%. This racial is the most
                    useful racial you get as a Night Elf Rogue, which says a
                    lot, seeing as it's almost useless.

                    hit by Nature spells by 2%. This is mostly negligible when
                    it comes to PvE.

                  <li>
                    <span>Shadowmeld</span>can be used in order to escape combat
                    and become stealthed once every 2 minutes. It will also
                    cause you to drop all threat on every target you're
                    currently engaged in combat with, but all threat will be
                    restored the moment you leave stealth — which will happen
                    the moment you move or take any action. Rogues get extra
                    value out of this ability, as they can enter

                  <li>
                    <span>Elusiveness</span>reduces the chance to be detected if
                    you are stealthed. This can certainly come in handy in solo
                    content, but you will struggle to find a use for it in
                    raids.

                    <span>Wisp Spirit</span>increases your movement speed by 75%
                    while dead. You generally don't want to be dead, but this
                    racial does mean you can sneak off for a bathroom break more
                    often.
