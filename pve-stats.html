                <h2>Stats Explanation</h2>
                <h3>Hit:</h3>
                <p>
                  Hit rating will be your most important stat — if you can't hit
                  your targets, you're not dealing damage. You gain a 1%
                  increased chance to hit for every 32.79 hit rating you have.
                  Furthermore, as a Rogue you get a 1% increased chance to hit
                  with your spells (poisons) for every 26.232 hit rating you
                  have.The soft-cap for dual-wielding melee hits versus level 83
                  (boss) enemies is 8%. You do not have to care about the
                  hard-cap, as it simply takes too much investment to reach.
                  Normally you would stop at that point, but we want to cap
                  spell hit for our poisons too — meaning we need a whopping 446
                  hit rating to cap, or 17% spell hit chance. That is an
                  excessively high amount, but thankfully we have ways to reduce
                  the amount needed. <br />
                  Assassination Rogues have access to the
                  <strong>Precision</strong> talent in the Combat tree, which
                  means that we only need 12% hit chance, or 315 hit rating.
                  Furthermore, having a Shadow Priest
                  <strong>(MiseryMisery)</strong> or Balance Druid
                  <strong>(Improved Faerie FireImproved Faerie Fire)</strong> in
                  your raid reduces that requirement by a further 3%, meaning we
                  need 9% hit chance, or 237 hit rating. Finally, having a
                  Draenei in your party (not raid) gives you the
                  <strong>Heroic Presence</strong> aura, which offers an extra
                  1% hit chance, meaning you need 8% hit chance to cap, or 210
                  rating — or, if you don't have a Shadow Priest / Balance Druid
                  in your raid, you need 11% hit chance, or 289 hit rating.
                </p>
                <h3>Expertise:</h3>
                <p>
                  Expertise (and expertise rating) will be your 2nd most
                  important stat — again, if you can't hit your targets, you're
                  not dealing damage. You gain 1 expertise for every 8.1974
                  expertise rating you have. 1 expertise reduces the chance that
                  your attacks get dodged or parried by 0.25%. However,
                  expertise has an unfortunate quirk: you cannot have fractional
                  amounts of it. For example, if your character has 111
                  expertise rating in total, you will end up with 13 expertise,
                  rather than 13.54 which is what you get if you divide 111 by
                  8.1974.
                  <br />
                  The soft-cap for melee hits versus level 83 (boss) enemies is
                  26 expertise, reducing the chance that your attacks get dodged
                  by 6.5%. You do not have to care about the hard-cap, which
                  involves eliminating parries, as you should always be
                  attacking the boss from behind, and enemies cannot parry from
                  behind. This means that melee characters need 214 expertise
                  rating in order to reach the expertise cap. Assassination
                  Rogues unfortunately don't have access to any
                  expertise-boosting talents, and there are no racial traits
                  that boost expertise when using daggers, so we need to get
                  that very high amount in order to cap.
                </p>
                <h3>Attack Power:</h3>
                <p>
                  Attack power makes your attacks and poisons hit harder, and
                  therefore it is the core stat of assassination. For
                  Assassination Rogues specifically, you'll really want to focus
                  on Attack Power because it scales so well with poisons. A lot
                  of your consumables include AP as well, which in turn scale
                  with a lot of raid buffs (such as
                  <strong>Trueshot Aura</strong>,
                  <strong>Greater Blessing of Might</strong>, or any other
                  talent or buff that directly increases attack power).
                </p>
                <h3>Armor Penetration</h3>
                <p>
                  Armor Penetration is one of the most powerful stat in WotLK,
                  as it severely enhances all the physical damage dealt. The cap
                  for Armor penetration is 1400, when it comes to PvP gear, you
                  can not attain the cap itself, but you can create a mix
                  between PvP items and PvE items in order to get as close as
                  possible to the cap. However, Armor Penetration is a weak stat
                  in the beginning phases of the game, as you can not possibly
                  come close to the cap, having Attack Power as the superior
                  stat. Towards the end of the expansion, you will want to get
                  as close as possible to the cap!
                </p>
                <h3>Haste Rating</h3>
                <p>
                  Haste is pretty straightforward, it makes you hit faster, so
                  it also makes your poisons proc more and make you auto-attack
                  faster. You gain 1% increased attack speed for every 32.79
                  haste rating you have.
                  <br />
                  Haste also indirectly boosts your energy regeneration rate
                  through things like talents
                  <strong>(Focused Attacks)</strong>, set bonuses etc, which
                  further boosts your damage. Just the fact that it causes your
                  poisons to hit more often however makes haste extremely strong
                  for Assassination Rogues.
                  <br />
                  At a certain point, when your gear is strong enough, haste
                  rating will actually become as powerful as attack power for
                  you. You will have to use a simulation program in order to
                  figure out that point however, so we'll be recommending it
                  below attack power in this guide.
                </p>
                <h3>Agility</h3>
                <p>
                  As a Rogue, you gain 1 Attack Power per 1 point of Agility, as
                  well as an increased chance to crit for each point of Agility
                  you have (83.33 Agility per 1% Crit). These amounts are
                  further increased by 10% when buffed with
                  <strong>Greater Blessing of King</strong>, meaning you gain
                  0.1AP and 0.1% Crit more per Agility when having kings up.
                  This means that 1 point of Agility is always better than 1
                  point of Attack Power, but you usually get 2 points of Attack
                  Power for each 1 point of Agility from most sources (for
                  example, gems, enchant and gear), meaning Agility doesn't make
                  Attack Power obsolete.
                </p>
                <h3>Crit Rating</h3>
                <p>
                  Crit is good on any physical damage class, including Assassin
                  Rogues, it just gets outshined by the other stats due to the
                  fact we have we don't have a lot powerful crit-scaling
                  effects. It's not something you're going to chase, but it's
                  not a stat you want to avoid either.
                  <br />
                  One of the reasons Haste is better is because you need less
                  Haste rating to get 1% Haste than you need Crit rating to get
                  1% Crit, making it an ”expensive” stat.
                </p>
                <h3>Armor Penetration</h3>
                <p>
                  Armor penetration is an incredibly strong stat for most
                  physical damage dealers — but sadly, Assassination Rogues
                  aren't in that list. It only affects our melee attacks and
                  <strong>Mutilate</strong>, as all of our other abilities deal
                  Nature damage and thus naturally bypass armor. You should
                  avoid it when you see it on gear as much as you can — but
                  inevitably some of your items will have a little bit of it on
                  them.
                </p>

                <h3>Strength</h3>
                <p>
                  Strength gives you attack power, like agility does, without
                  offering a bonus crit chance. You never want to chase it, as
                  items with strength on them tend to lack other stats that we
                  desire (like agility + attack power, which generally come in a
                  package deal and are stronger) and thus will be sub-par for
                  you. However, strength buffs like
                  <strong>Horn of Winter</strong> will still help you, so keep
                  it in mind.
                </p>
