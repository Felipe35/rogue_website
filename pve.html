          <h2 class="intro-tittle">Intro</h2>
          <p class="intro">
            Combat Rogues are light-armored combatants that prefer to directly
            engage their enemies, choosing to wield heavy weapons that hack and
            slash their foes. Their gameplay uses very few elements of stealth,
            choosing to venture headfirst directly into the battlefield, rapidly
            attacking enemies in a killing spree. Their proficiency with weapons
            of various types speaks for itself — the Combat Rogues wake is
            riddled with the corpses of slain monsters.
          </p>
          <h4 class="h4-strengths">Combat Rogue Strengths</h4>
          <!-- Strengths -->
          <ul class="ul-list-strengths">
            <li class="list green">Top tier single target damage</li>
            <li class="list-text">
              Combat Rogues have some of the strongest single target DPS in the
              game. With good play, you’ll always find yourself near the top of
              DPS meters.
            </li>
            <li class="list green">Top tier AoE damage</li>
            <li class="list-text">
              Like most other melee, Rogues traditionally fared poorly on AoE
              damage (meaning 5+ targets), which was typically the domain of
              Warlocks and Mages. This is no longer the case: the addition of
              Fan of KnivesFan of Knives propels Rogues to the top of the meters
              in AoE-heavy fights, right alongside casters, and way above most
              other melee specs, which typically are still limited to cleaving
              3-4 targets at a time.
            </li>
            <li class="list green">Simple, unchanged rotation</li>
            <li class="list-text">
              While WotLK made the DPS rotation of a lot of specs more complex,
              things barely changed at all for Combat Rogues — our rotation is
              more or less unchanged, and it’s still arguably the simplest in
              the game, with no fancy macros needed to do well. That makes
              getting into Combat Rogue very easy, particularly for people that
              want to try a new class, or who want to play their Rogue alt more.
            </li>
            <li class="list green">Highly stackable spec</li>
            <li class="list-text">
              Unlike in TBC, where most guilds would typically only bring 1
              Rogue at most for the Expose ArmorExpose Armor debuff, Rogues are
              now highly stackable thanks to their incredibly high damage and
              the incredibly useful Tricks of the TradeTricks of the Trade. Many
              guilds may bring as many as 4 to 5 Combat Rogues in their Icecrown
              Citadel rosters. Gone are the days of having to beg people for a
              raid spot!
            </li>
          </ul>

          <!-- Weaknesses -->
          <h4 class="h4-Weaknesses">Combat Rogue Weaknesses</h4>
          <ul class="ul-list-weaknesses">
            <li class="list red">Very high loot competition</li>
            <li class="list-text">
              A downside of being a highly stackable class that most raid groups
              will have multiple of is that, well, you’re competing against a
              LOT of people. This gets particularly ugly when it comes to
              weapons, as each raid tier typically has ~2 viable main hands and
              ~2 viable off-hands, so if you’ve got a whole bunch of Rogues,
              some of them will likely have to settle with weaker weapons, or
              may just never get a weapon upgrade that tier if you get unlucky
              with drops.
            </li>
            <li class="list red">Highly reliant on gear</li>
            <li class="list-text">
              Combat Rogues are strong, dealing incredible damage, as mentioned
              in the Strengths section. However, they’re highly reliant on good
              quality gear in order to achieve this strength — their base damage
              is not particularly impressive, but rather, their scaling is
              great. For the first couple of raid tiers, many Rogues will choose
              to go Assassination instead, biding their time until they’ve got
              the gear to switch to Combat.
            </li>
            <li class="list red">Limited utility</li>
            <li class="list-text">
              Combat Rogues don’t have weak utility, by any means — our Tricks
              of the TradeTricks of the Trade on its own is already plenty
              powerful. However, compared to other classes, we just don’t have
              that much to offer besides our damage, having the fewest raid buff
              / debuff effects of any class in the game.
