        <!-- Best Races for PVP -->
        <section class="section-p-intro">
          <p>
            There are a variaty of choices to select a race, on the two
            different facctions: <strong>Horde and Alliance</strong>, The most
            notable choices for Subtlety Rogues are Human and Night Elf for the
            Alliance and Orc or Undead for the Horde. Read on for a more
            detailed discussion on all of the available choices!
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            In WoTLK Classic, players have several choices when it comes to
            playing the Rogue class for PvP content. All available options are
            listed below in order of strength.
          </p>

                  <strong>Orc:</strong> first available choice for the Rogue
                  class in the Horde, and often considered one of the stronger
                  choices, Orcs provided two powerful effects that can
                  significantly enhance Player-versus-Player combat.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  The first racial effect we will talk about is
                  <strong>Hardiness</strong>, an effect that reduces the
                  duration of stun effects by 15%, which can make a difference
                  between winning and losing in a situation when your trinket is
                  on cooldown.
                </p>
                <br />The second interesting racial is
                <strong>Blood Fury</strong>, an effect that acts as an attack
                power increase for 15 seconds, scaling with level. The total
                attack power gained at level 80 would be 322. Blood FuryBlood
                Fury is a very strong racial for bursting down your enemies,
                especially against squishy casters!

                  <strong>Undead:</strong> Undeads provide one strong racial
                  effect that can severely enhance Player-versus-Player combat,
                  plus a few average passives that can help along the way.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  <strong>Will of the Forsaken </strong>is a powerful racial
                  which acts as a trinket, removing charm, sleep, and fear
                  effects. Obviously, being able to remove multiple types of
                  hard-CC is incredibly effective in PvP. Having more responses
                  to crowd control is always a strong option!.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  The second racial that we will talk about is an all-time
                  Undead trademark, <strong>Cannibalize</strong>. It allows you
                  to feast upon the corpses of your fallen enemies. Not only
                  does it regenerate your health points, but it also instills
                  terror in those watching this unspeakable act. This racial
                  effect is a very potent makeshift heal, however, it has fewer
                  uses in arenas than in battlegrounds and the open world.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Less spooky but still often relevant in PvP, Undead also have
                  <strong>Shadow Resistance</strong>, an effect that reduces the
                  chance to be hit by Shadow spells by 2%. While it won't be
                  useful in every arena match, 2% isn't insignificant, and there
                  are enough shadow casters in PvP to make this worth
                  mentioning.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally, If you feel like being a silent predator,
                  <strong>Underwater Breathing</strong> will allow you to hide
                  inside large bodies of water for a very long time, waiting for
                  any unsuspecting prey that you have set your eyes upon; not
                  super important in Arenas, but useful in Battlegrounds with
                  water, or world PvP.

                  <strong>Troll:</strong> Another choice for the Rogue class,
                  Trolls provide two strong racial ability that can enhance your
                  burst damage and other moderately powerful racials that can
                  improve some aspects of our gameplay.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  The first of these is <strong>Berserking</strong>, which
                  increases our attack speed by 20% for 10 seconds. This can be
                  used to enhance our burst window, especially at the beginning
                  of the fight. Berserking is a great racial effect that can be
                  stacked with any other similar effects such as
                  Bloodlust/Heroism and Slice and Dice, making it a really
                  powerful burst tool.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  The second notable effect is <strong> Regeneration</strong>,
                  which increases health regeneration by 10%, while also
                  allowing us to regenerate 10% of our health during combat.
                  Trolls are the only race that allows you to regenerate your
                  health while in combat, making this racial effect a very
                  strong self-sustain tool!
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  <strong>Da Voodoo Shuffle</strong> is another useful racial
                  for PvP, as it reduces the duration of all movement-impairing
                  effects by 15%. This effect will protect you from classes that
                  love to spam slow effects!.

                  <strong>Human:</strong> Often considered the best choice for
                  Alliance Rogues, Humans provide several strong racial effects
                  that can improve your overall gameplay.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Every Man for Himself</strong> effectively acts as a
                  trinket, allowing you to clear all CC. This allows Humans to
                  use double DPS trinkets, boosting their damage by a
                  considerable amount. This is by far the strongest PvP racial
                  in the entire game, as it allows you to considerably boost
                  your damage!
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  <strong>Perception</strong> greatly increases the chance to
                  detect stealthed targets, giving us an advantage when fighting
                  other classes that are capable of using stealth. This racial
                  effect is great against other rogues or feral druids, as it
                  allows you to engage first!.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Humans also possess <strong>Diplomacy</strong>, an effect that
                  increases your overall reputation gain by 10%. This effect can
                  be quite handy when trying to grab items that require
                  reputation grind.

                  aid you in fighting melee classes, plus some average racial
                  effects that do not strongly impact your PvP performance.

                <p>
                  Dwarves' notable racial is <strong>Stoneform</strong>: this
                  active skill offers us a 10% increase in armor and removes all
                  poison, bleed, and disease effects, lasting for 8 seconds.
                  They also have Frost ResistanceFrost Resistance, which reduces
                  the chance to be hit by Frost spells by 2% — given the
                  popularity of Frost Mages in Arena matches, this is often a
                  useful PvP racial.

                  The first racial effect we will talk about is
                  <strong>Shadowmeld</strong>. While Rogues do not require
                  another stealth mechanic, this racial effect can be used as a
                  tool to remove your opponent's target from yourself. This
                  effect can be very strong in certain situations.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  <strong>Elusiveness</strong> severely enhances our Stealth
                  capabilities while also affecting <strong>Shadowmeld</strong>.
                  This effect can become extremely strong when combined with our
                  talents.

                  Another racial effect worthy of note is
                  <strong> Quickness</strong>, which reduces the chance to be
                  hit by ranged and melee attacks by 2%.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Quickness</strong> forces your enemy to have a higher
                  Hit Rating in order for their attacks to be useful against
                  you! They will require at least 7% Hit Chance to hit you if
                  they are a melee class and an 8% Hit Chance if they are a
                  caster class.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  <strong>Nature Resistance</strong> is a great racial effect
                  against Druids and Shamans! It has an effect similar to
                  <strong>Quickness</strong>, reducing the chance to be hit by
                  Nature spells by 2%.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  The last unique racial effect available to Night Elves is
                  <strong>Wisp Spirit</strong>. This effect turns you into a
                  wisp upon death, increasing your movement speed by 75%. This
                  racial has little significance in battlegrounds or arenas, but
                  it can be very helpful in open-world PvP scenarios.
