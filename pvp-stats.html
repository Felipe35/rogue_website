              <h2>Stats Explanation</h2>
              <h3>Hit:</h3>
              <p>
                Hit Rating is the most important stat that you can acquire as it
                allows you to properly hit your enemy! Without proper Hit
                Rating, most of your attacks will miss your target, even if you
                position yourself properly behind them. When it comes to Hit
                Rating you will want to have a 5% hit rating at all times to
                ensure that your attacks will not miss. You can work with under
                a 5% Hit Rating, however, your attacks will have a high chance
                to fail. In order to achieve a 5% Hit Rating, you will need 164
                Hit Rating! Keep in mind that there are effects in the game such
                as Heroic PresenceHeroic Presence that will reduce the overall
                Hit Rating you require.
              </p>
              <h3>Expertise:</h3>
              <p>
                Expertise is one of the most important stats to ensure that your
                attacks will not be dodged or parried. It is not advised to try
                to cap Expertise, however, as you will not want your attacks to
                be parried by melee classes, especially when taking into
                consideration that a lot of classes have talents that improve
                their parry chance, it is advised to acquire a bare minimum
                expertise rating. A value of 40 to 60 expertise rating will
                prove more than enough to make sure that your chance of being
                parried or dodged will be drastically reduced.
              </p>
              <h3>Resilience:</h3>
              <p>
                Resilience is the next stat that we will talk about, resilience
                is the most important stat when it comes to Player-versus-Player
                combat. Resilience reduces any incoming damage taken from other
                players while also reducing the chance to be affected by
                critical strikes and the damage taken from any pet. When it
                comes to playing a Subtlety Rogue, you have two possible choices
                when it comes to resilience. You can choose to go full
                resilience while considerably reducing all the damage you are
                dealing. This works if you are paired with a high damage dealer.
                With the first option, you will want to have around 1300
                resilience by the end of the expansion and at least 700
                resilience at the beginning of the expansion. The second choice
                when it comes to resilience is to choose a mix between PvP and
                PvE items, having resilience in itself as a lower priority. With
                the second option, you will want to acquire around 800
                resilience!
              </p>
              <h3>Armor Penetration</h3>
              <p>
                Armor Penetration is one of the most powerful stat in WotLK, as
                it severely enhances all the physical damage dealt. The cap for
                Armor penetration is 1400, when it comes to PvP gear, you can
                not attain the cap itself, but you can create a mix between PvP
                items and PvE items in order to get as close as possible to the
                cap. However, Armor Penetration is a weak stat in the beginning
                phases of the game, as you can not possibly come close to the
                cap, having Attack Power as the superior stat. Towards the end
                of the expansion, you will want to get as close as possible to
                the cap!
              </p>
              <h3>Attack Power</h3>
              <p>
                Attack Power is a stat that enhances our physical damage
                capabilities, allowing us to deal more damage to our targets.
                Attack power gems are considerably stronger earlier in the game
                than Armor Penetration gems and should be prioritized. There is
                no specific number for how much Attack Power you should gather,
                our only recommendation is that you should stack as much as
                possible of it from your equipment, gems, and enchantments!
              </p>
              <h3>Agility</h3>
              <p>
                Agility is a stat innate to the Rogue class, enhancing both our
                Critical Strike Chance and our Attack power. However, you should
                never use agility gems or general agility enchantments as raw
                attack power is stronger than agility. You will gain plenty of
                Agility from your equipment alone!
              </p>
              <h3>Critical Strike Chance</h3>
              <p>
                Critical Strike Chance is a stat that increases our chance of
                dealing critical strikes. This stat is innate to our gear and
                should never be enhanced through gems. We recommend you reach
                around 30% critical strike chance at the beginning of the
                expansion with 55% critical strike chance being a great number
                for the end of the expansion.
