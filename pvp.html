          <p class="intro">
            This guide will teach you how to properly play Subtlety Rogue in PvP
            scenarios in WTLK expantion, whether those might be battlegrounds,
            arenas, or the open world. To navigate to the different sections,
            just use the buttons at the top of the guide!

          <h1 class="h1-strengths">Subtlety Rogue Strengths</h1>
          <!-- Strengths -->
          <ul class="ul-list-strengths">
            <li class="list green">Extremely Powerful Crowd-Control</li>
            <li class="list-text">
              Subtlety Rogues have a large number of crowd control tools,
              effectively being able to CC-lock a target almost indefinitely.
              These include Sap, Cheap Shot, Kidney Shot, Blind, Garrote, Gouge,
              and Kick. If used correctly, you can almost permanently disable
              your target!
            </li>
            <li class="list green">Powerful Burst Damage</li>
            <li class="list-text">
              Subtlety Rogues are masters of the shadows, a fact emphasized by
              their most powerful abilities, Shadowstep and Shadow Dance. With
              the help of those abilities, and combined with their offensive
              strengths, they are capable of one-shotting a large variety of
              classes and specializations. Keep in mind, however, that while
              they do have this capacity, it requires very good energy
              management in order to pull it off!
            </li>
            <li class="list green">Stealth Class</li>
            <li class="list-text">
              As a Rogue, you are one of the few select classes that can enjoy
              the benefits of pure invisibility. With StealthStealth, you can
              stalk your enemies, carefully plan any ambush, and gather intel on
              the enemy faction. This mechanic instills fear in your enemies,
              forcing them to adopt a cautious play style. Aside from
              Battlegrounds and Arenas, you will fully enjoy the benefits of
              Stealth in the Open World, often finding yourself either scouting
              foreign territory or stalking unsuspecting prey.
            </li>
            <li class="list green">Fun Playstyle</li>
            <li class="list-text">
              Subtlety Rogue is an extremely fun class, even with its high
              difficulty level. You will experience pure adrenaline while
              playing this specialization, as you will often find yourself
              either one-shotting your targets or fighting tough battles. The
              specialization itself requires high APM, cautious planning and
              fast reactions, making it a breath of fresh air when compared to a
              mindless single-button-mashing specialization.

          <!-- Weaknesses -->
          <h1 class="h1-Weaknesses">Subtlety Rogue Weaknesses</h1>
          <ul class="ul-list-weaknesses">
            <li class="list red">No Self-Sustain</li>
            <li class="list-text">
              While Subtlety Rogues have extreme amounts of burst potential and
              crowd control, they lack any form of self-sustain, often being
              forced to run away from their targets when heavily damaged. This
              can of course be mitigated with an abundant supply of food or a
              trusty healer!
            </li>
            <li class="list red">Hard to Master</li>
            <li class="li">
              Subtlety Rogue is one of the specializations that requires
              meticulous planning and an extreme reaction time, often being
              forced to perform a perfect sequence of abilities in order to
              eliminate their targets quickly. Since the class is based on
              energy, a resource that is a lot harder to manage than mana or
              rage, any mistake that you do will be hard to recover from and
              will surely halt your momentum.
            </li>
            <li class="list red">
              Difficult to play against plate-wearing classes
            </li>
            <li class="list-text">
              Subtlety Rogues are very powerful against most types of armor,
              however, they struggle to pierce targets that wear plate armor.
              Since plate-wearing classes are often extremely tanky and
              resilient, you will have a hard time bursting them. You will often
              find yourself simply dying in the process while they outlast you
              if you do not execute your combo perfectly.
